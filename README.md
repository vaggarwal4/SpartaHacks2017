# StandAgainstHarassment
We reach out the people who are getting harassed on social media and the platform suitable for this is twitter cause almost everyone is using it even the celebs and the politicians and also reporting the bully or the person harassing the victim We firstly collected the data using twitterAPI and then we tweak the data and tokenize it and then filter it. After getting the processed data. We have designed a sentiment analysis code to judge the sentiment of the tweet and find the positive and negative sentiment. And also the level insanity crossed the people. So after this we were able to find out the accounts who are bullying the people on twitter. So we can reach out to them and help them overcome this. And Also we will prevent the accounts who are doing it by reporting their account so that they wont be able to hurt other person
